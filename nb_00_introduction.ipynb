    "In the `Nilearn2022` folder you will find this and 2 other notebooks. Each notebook will introduce you to a different type of statistical analysis in fMRI and show you how to analyze fMRI data using the `Nilearn` package. \n",

    "The first notebook will begin by talking you through the basics of the `Nibabel` and `Nilearn` packages. After this, we will cover in detail first-level analyses. The second notebook will show you how to perform a second-level analysis and give further discussion of statistic values and thresholding your images."
